# CLASS/STATIC PROPERTIES

## INTRODUCTION [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)

This repository is a simple single file directory that shows how to create static properties and methods, as well as how to access and manipulate their values.

At this point, we should be conversant with what a `class` is. But for reference purpose, a `class` defines all the methods & properties of an object but doesn't give it any information. `Classes` can have functions inside of them which is called a `method`
